# Final Assessment 

## Self Assessment 

### Role 
My role during the final project was the machine learning partner. I was responsible, once the team determined the ML direction, to sketch the model and provide the framework code from the courseware approach. It was in this role that my personal challenge of limited understanding the concepts of ML would cause me to worry about not contributing my fair share. Diving back into the modules and the internet to re-learn the topics I had felt weak on helped the team overall as I was able to contribute with code from one of the module challenges to get the team off the ground. 
 
### Contrbution
What I felt was a solid contribution always felt short due to my being unfamilair with the back end side of computer. I felt the I was going to either hold the team back or marginalize myself with the lack of quality contributions.  This concern led my to review the modules and make sure tht I understood the precedeing modules that the final project depends.  The amount of time I spent on the course doubled as I felt my way back through the courseware so that when the time came to provide a contribution I was able to participate in the evening discussons.  In addition to the extra review, I was able to leverage my current academic efforts to research the project to provide additonal analysis to the team.  I may not be a strong codewriter, but I can research.

### Personal Challenge
Beginning with the overall course as a challenge, I knew that I would be struggling to catch up with the concepts, language process, and courseware.  My understanding what I lacked early in the process helped shape my ability to contribute to my team.  I felt that I have learned more than I had planned to learn in th ecourse and being part of the team in the end showed I have gained a new understanding of myslef and what I am capable of when it comes to "advanced" technology.  GITHub was my own personal nightmare- I was tenetaive in the commits ( made them all) beacuase I didn't understand the concept and didn't want to accidently delete a branch of work. The team was spot on with each other getting the GIT done.

## Team Assessment
The team had the opportunity to work together on a mini-project prior to the final project.  Alex and Hannah were the only two I had littel experience with, but came to find out the two of them fit nicely in with the project. Sarah's attitude brough a postive aire to the team that meshed nicely with Alex and the others. Darin's drive to accomplish the project and keeping the team from wandering was refreshing the further we accomplished the tasks within the rubric and closer we moved towards the objective of a finished project.

### Commuinicaton
Slack and the zoom capabilitie available made the project run smoothly while the interaction among the team was polite, professional, and at times jovial.  It was a pleasure working with the team.

### Strengths
What the team lacked in competency we had in drive. The excitement to accomplish the project and at times the energy to look further than we should made accomplishing the task easier.  There was no dragging or stumbling to play catch up, however some evenings prior to turn in the internal team deadlines were rough but that was minor considering we made deadlines and production goals.  The team works well and contributes, listens, and enhances the learning environment making is a comfortable place to challenge and grow.

## Project Summary

### Selected Topic:  
  Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease
#### Reason for Topic:  
  Heart Disease affects us all and we have each been affected to various degrees by this disease. 
#### Source of Data Description:  
  The data source contains 18 variables with Heart Disease as the first column which is the Explanatory Variable.  
### Machine module used: Supervised Machine Learning 
In a supervised machine learning environment the input data is refined into paired outcomes. The paired outcomes then provide a "supervised" lens that facilitates the training and test of the supervised machine learning model to predict potential coorelations using new data. 
#### Logistic Regression Model
As previously mentioned, the team used a supervised machine-learning model. More specifically, the model is a logistic regression model. This regression model is a classification algorithm to predict binary outcomes centered on independent variables. The idea of binary outcomes means two answers to the query. First, this project looks at whether an individual is prone to heart disease or not to developing heart disease after considering a series of independent variables such as gender, age, sleep habits, and eating habits. The outcome is either True or False (dependent variable). The outcome the team expects is the likihood of conditons being likely or unlikely. Preliminary analysis suggests the team could apply the SMOTEENN model to conduct the supervised machine learning on the heart disease dataset. The courseware covering the SMOTEENN technique supports the team's assessment to avoid the traps of oversampling the data and apply the benefits of both oversampling and undersampling as discussed in Module 17 of the course. For example, within the first run of the machine-learning model, the code returned zero output after waiting approximately 45 minutes. The image below provides the SMOTEENN coding

### Results of the analysis 
Accuracy was 76% for our heart disease variable according to the outputs. The recall for heart disease was 77%, which is important because we want to cast a wide net for detecting heart disease so that people can do follow-up monitoring recall in this case is more important than precision for heart disease. We determined that the identification of heart disease varibles were not as earth shattering as anticipated.  the results of the project provided us the mechanics to ML a problem and determine the process of conducting a project was fruitful and worked.
