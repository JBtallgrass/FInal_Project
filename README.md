# Final Assessment 

## Self Assessment 

### Role 
My role during the final project was the machine learning partner. I was responsible, once the team determined the ML direction, to sketch the model and provide the framework code from the courseware approach. It was in this role that my personal challenge of limited understanding the concepts of ML would cause me to worry about not contributing my fair share. Diving back into the modules and the internet to re-learn the topics I had felt weak on helped the team overall as I was able to contribute with code from one of the module challenges to get the team off the ground.
