# Final Assessment 

## Self Assessment 

  ### Role 
  My role during the final project was the machine learning partner. I was responsible, once the team determined the ML direction, to sketch the model and provide the framework code from the courseware approach. It was in this role that the challenge of understanding the concepts of ML and which would be the best for what the team decided was the challenge.
